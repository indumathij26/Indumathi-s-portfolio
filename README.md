Hello! I'm an enthusiastic Data Analyst with a knack for transforming data into meaningful insights. My background is in Electrical and Electronics Engineering, but I found my true passion in the world of data and statistics.

I have strong skills in MS Excel, Power BI, SQL, and Python, which I leverage to analyze and visualize data effectively. Although I'm just starting my professional journey, I've worked on several business projects that you can view in my GitHub portfolio. These projects highlight my ability to solve real-world data problems.

I am committed to continuous learning and growth. I'm excited about the opportunity to join a team where I can apply my skills to drive data-informed decisions and contribute to business success. Please feel free to explore my work and let's talk about how I can add value to your organization.
